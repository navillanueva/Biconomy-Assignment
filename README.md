# Developer Relations Engineer Assignment

The goal of this repo is to showcase the power of the Biconomy SDK using Account Abstraction to create a script that mint's an NFT paying the gas with USDC.

## Installation

To run this locally, paste the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/navillanueva/Biconomy-Assignment.git
```

Once the repo has been cloned, run:

```bash
  yarn install
```

You can also use **npm** as your package manager.

Now that you have everything set up, you can run the following command that will run the script:

```bash
  yarn run mintNFTgasUSDC
```

The gas for the cost of minting this NFT will be payed by default in USDC as stated in the assignment. Upon successful mint you will see several details printed to your terminal which include: the useroperation information, userop hash, and transaction detail information once confirmed.

Thank you for your time!
